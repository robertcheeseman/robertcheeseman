### Welcome!  My name is Robert and I'm an audio engineer turned software developer
<hr>

I'm really drawn to Front End development as I thoroughly enjoy the creative aspect of watching something beautiful come together from its inception all the way to finished product

Some of my other interests include:
- Audio Engineering
- Playing Guitar and Bass
- Travel (27 Countries and counting!)
- Snowboarding
- Collecting vinyl records
- Concerts/Shows
- Adventuring with my wife and our pup, Marley
